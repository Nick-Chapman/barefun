## examples

Some `.fun` examples to drive development and testing.

- Most examples have [Cram tests](../test-evaluation).
- Most examples have [expected compilation files](../compile-examples/expected).

TODO: Move the examples under a `test/` umbrella directory.

TODO: Remove the more pointless tests: i.e. `cut`, `oneArm`, `halts`.
