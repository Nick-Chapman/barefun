## bits

Old bits and pieces. Probably not worth keeping.

- [old-make-x86](old-make-x86) : Makefile based build/run for `nasm` and `qemu`. Before we moved to dune.
- [x86/examples](x86/examples) : Makefile based setup for trying small x86 code fragments.
- [x86/repl](x86/repl) : Hand written x86 code for a repl-fragment; drove the project early on.
